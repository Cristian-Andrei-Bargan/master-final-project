# Final_project_master
My final project for my master degree in Data Technology.

This project aims to help in detecting full trash bins for a more efficient collecting. For training and testing, I used a dataset from Kaggle. [1]
A full documentation ("Documentatie" file) can be found in Romanian language.

The application is able to perform two task of computer vision:
- Image classification [2]
- Object detection [3]

In order to use the project, it is necessary to perform the following steps:
- Go to "disertatie-app" in your terminal
- Run the following command:
```
streamlit run main_app_page.py
```
