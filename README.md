# Final_project_master
My final project for my master degree in Data Technology.

This project aims to help in detecting full trash bins for a more efficient collecting. For training and testing, I used a dataset from Kaggle. (1)
A full documentation ("Documentatie" file) can be found in Romanian language.

The application is able to perform two task of computer vision:
- Image classification (2)
